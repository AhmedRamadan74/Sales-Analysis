# Sales-Analysis

Design and develop a comprehensive dashboard to monitor and analyze key business metrics across sales, revenue, customer behavior, and shipping operations. The dashboard provides: 
## Sales Insights: 

Real-time sales performance tracking by product, category, region, and sales channels. Comparative analysis of sales trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly). 
## Revenue Analysis: 

Detailed revenue breakdown, including gross and net revenue. Key drivers of revenue growth and their contribution percentages. Identification of high-performing products or services contributing to revenue. 
## Customer Metrics: 

Analysis of customer demographics and purchasing behavior. Customer segmentation (e.g., new vs. repeat customers) to tailor strategies. Insights into customer lifetime value (CLV) and churn rates. 
## Shipping Operations: 

Tracking shipment statuses and delivery times. Monitoring shipping costs and their impact on profit margins. Identifying bottlenecks and delays in the shipping pro.
